# Non-parametric (local-linear) regression to smooth flows

# Order of traits: husband then wife; age, edu, race
# Notation: husband gets _SP suffix, wife is default
# Min age is 25 because of endogeneity of college
# ACS data: 2008-2014, ages 18-79 (note: AGE_SP is not limited).

### Smoothing by Non-parametric Regression ###

# convert categorical variables to factors for npreg
for (col in c('COLLEGE', 'MINORITY')) set(mar.flow, j = col, value = factor(mar.flow[[col]]))
for (col in c('COLLEGE', 'MINORITY')) set(div.flow, j = col, value = factor(div.flow[[col]]))

# batch smoothing by MSA and SEX: add FLOW column to each data table
mar.flow[, FLOW := predict(npreg(bws=npregbw(formula = MF ~ AGE + COLLEGE + MINORITY,
											 regtype="ll",
											 bwmethod="cv.aic",
											 data=.SD)),
						   newdata=.SD),
         by = .(MSA, SEX)]
div.flow[, FLOW := predict(npreg(bws=npregbw(formula = DF ~ AGE + COLLEGE + MINORITY,
											 regtype="ll",

											 data=.SD)),
						   newdata=.SD),
         by = .(MSA, SEX)]


### Trim and Clean ###

# trim max.age (NOTE: max.age will be dropped in the estimation because of truncation)
mar.flow <- mar.flow[AGE <= max.age]
div.flow <- div.flow[AGE <= max.age]

# llr may give negative or tiny values: truncate to min of 1
mar.flow[FLOW < 1.0, FLOW := 1.0]
div.flow[FLOW < 1.0, FLOW := 1.0]


### Save flows and stocks ###

# by MSA and type
fwrite(mar.flow[SEX == 1, .(MSA, AGE, COLLEGE, MINORITY, FLOW)], file="data/men-MF.csv")
fwrite(mar.flow[SEX == 2, .(MSA, AGE, COLLEGE, MINORITY, FLOW)], file="data/wom-MF.csv")
